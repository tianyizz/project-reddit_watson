They're a new company that's inexperienced at creating software and thrust into the limelight of an unexplored field. You're expecting a polished experience from a company who aren't ready to present one yet. Furthermore, it should be noted that the reason they chose Facebook, other than the ludicrous sum of money that they were purchased for, was to ensure that VR WOULD NOT JUST BE ABOUT PC GAMING. Thus, if Oculus chooses to focus their releases on getting mobile VR going and exporing new technological possibilities with behind-the-scene R&amp;D, that's mission accomplished as far as they're concerned. \n\nOh, and Palmer Luckey still posts on the Oculus subreddit."

    "Original Text": "I'm sorry but it's hard to even bring myself to read the article all the way through when it starts off by stating that, \"The HTC Vive and Sony\u2019s Project Morpheus were just unveiled\", while the Project Morpheus was unveiled back in March 2014. And promptly after mentions \"Magic Leap\" when it has nothing to even do with VR. Already that makes me fully aware that the author is greatly uninformed and not in a position to write an article like this, and whatever points they make further down will likely be disregarded because I'm not sure I can trust what they're saying.\n\nThis misinformed writing only continues as the article goes on, making it clear that the author has not even tried any of these devices themselves. \"The images are still pixelated and lag a tiny bit\", the image isn't *that* bad at all. Sure, you notice the screen-door effect when you focus on it, but the image itself is fine. And nobody has reported any lag on the latest prototypes, I really don't know where the author took that from.\n\n&gt;They don\u2019t mean that VR is indistinguishable from reality. As Jason Jerald, a technology consultant for VR companies, puts it, \u201cWe can get very engaged in cartoon-like worlds.\u201d Images don\u2019t have to look perfect for presence.\n\nHere we see the author's misunderstanding of the quote. And misunderstanding of what VR needs to be. In order for VR to work, we don't need photorealistic computer graphics, which is what the quote says. Yet, the author insists that photorealistic graphics are essential.\n\nThe author then goes in depth into his statement that latency is killing VR. Which, like I said before, nobody else has reported is the case. I'm not saying there isn't latency, but by now, it's not the cause of motion sickness. The reason why people get motion sickness with the latest VR devices is not latency, but seeing movement on the screen while actually sitting/standing still. Which is why nobody got motion sickness in the HTC Vive demos where they walked around themselves, or any other standing-up demos shown recently. Many people get motion sick in a car, myself included. Is there latency involved anywhere? No.\n\nThe vergence-accommodation conflict is the first part of the article where the author writes anything sensible. And yes, while this is something that should be worked upon, it isn't a key element that destroys a VR experience.\n\nThe wide field-of-view problem is also real and needs to be heavily considered once VR devices start actually reaching these higher FOVs. For now, we'll have to make-do with the lower FOVs, which is far from the solution, but it's good enough for the time being. Once again, it doesn't pull you out of the experience.\n\nMovement is another problem that hasn't been solved. Many different solutions have been suggested, but all of them are either impractical or temporary workarounds.\n\nOverall, this article failed to say anything we don't already know and gave a lot of false information in the first half."

    "Original Text": "VR headsets are very far from being a \"really fancy monitor\". There's completely different approaches: Gear VR / Zeiss One and all other mobile based headsets don't even have positional tracking (like the DK1). DK2 does have positional tracking but it has a comparatively small area where you can move and only works reliably when you're not turned the other way. SteamVR/Vive on the other hand, has near-perfect room-scale tracking and perfectly tracked controllers.\n\nSo there's actually complete games mechanics that will be totally awesome for SteamVR/Vive (or any \"room-scale VR setup\") that won't really work well with hardware that is oriented towards standing or seated experiences. On the other hand, if you have room-scale VR hardware (like SteamVR / Vive), you can of course easily play games that were designed only for seated/standing hardware.\n\nConcerning APIs: I believe currently, the most versatile approach is using SteamVR because this does support Oculus but also supports SteamVR/Vive. So from the purely technical perspective, you develop once and can run at least these both.\n\nWith Unity 5.1, you have native Oculus integration, native HoloLens integration is announced (that's AR, so it's a different story but it is related) ... Project Morpheus is already supported for Unity (but as far as I know not with the native integration that came with 5.1). Hopefully, eventually you'll be able to have a unified API/approach in Unity that allows you to build for all relevant different hardware approaches. And probably UE4 will be doing the same (they already have native SteamVR integration AFAIK)."

The way I see it, the base stations communicate with the PC, the same way Oculus' camera does.  It shoots lasers, looks at the time it takes to come back and then finds out the distance and position.  The holes on the Vive are like reflectors that the base station recognizes.  Look at \"Tested\" interview with a Valve engineer for some insight.  \n\nIt does not changes your point but it's still ouside-in and it could not work with GearVR since the data is sent to a PC, from the base stations.\n\nEdit: rewatched the talk and you are right it is inside out but not using patterns projected on wall, it uses timing of the lasers.  Anyway it cannot be used for gearvr because the libraries by Valve are not for Android nor for ARM, although they might be someday."

Lets all be honest here, if Vive only ships with portal 3, and half life 3, won't everyone buy it just for those few launch titles?  And developers can release titles steadily after that initial launch date for a hardware solution we all have?  Frankly I am beating my head trying to figure out what Oculus can release xmas 15 that would steal away HALF LIFE 3 VR?  Or portal 3 VR?  Carmack did release a game called rage, but it didn't do very well.  What if Valve have DUKE NUKEM VR ready to go? ;)  Or star wars KOTOR VR ready to go?  Or have MMO deal with warcraft VR ready to go on Valve vive solution?  What does oculus do?  The ONLY thing that may tempt me away from Valve and Half Life VR is if nintendo release super mario VR on virtual boy 2 this Xmas, but I don't think so.  SO valve it is, Half life 3 VR here we come (even if they have nothing else ready to go, but I think they will have lots more than just that at xmas release date)"

Apparently this martinlandau 00100100 and others that digideger brings up did use it.  Has lots of inside info.  Is trying his best to inform vive subreddit, valve steamvr subreddit, and other vr community members of what he can and not make his friends at Valve unhappy.  There may be ndas involved.  Still he feels it's important this community know certain details and histories.  Especially since for almost a year people at various subreddit thought Gabe and palmer were best friends and half life 3 was coming out on oculus hardware and maybe supported in oculus store.  So consider the messages here as public service announcements to help the Vive community.  Some may lack history.  Context.  Details.  This could affect their business decisions.  They may choose one solution over another.  The more informed they are, the better choices they can make.  Why would oculus moderators not let the community read this information and make up their own mind?   here is how it may affect you.  Maybe you as a developer were thinking of half life 3 extensions or add-ons and by being misinformed were making business plans for oculus hardware and software.  Thinking as many did that Gabe and palmer were beat buddies and half life 3 was coming out on oculus cv1.  However since that is not the case, it's better to have more information so developers and consumers can make better decisions for their future.  As digideger said about this martinlandau 00100100 persons or persons.  They got palmer started in 2009.  Know a lot about what is going on behind the scenes.  That oculus is not cool.  No half life 3.  Cause they angered gaben.  No mine craft vr because they angered notch. No 150 fov lenses because they angered david smith.  So it's been stormy seas.  Lots of us were unsure where to go.  Our ships crashing all over the vr sea.  But I have seen Gaben's lighthouse on the shore and he is going to bring me safely home through an awesome vr portal of security.  I hope you make the right choice"

We bought one and had to completely rearrange our living room, tipping sofas up against the wall on end, to have the space to use it every time we wanted to.\n\nSame goes for the Vive. IIRC it needs a 4'x6' space, minimum. I *just about* have that in my living room, in front of my TV, but I sure as hell don't in my office where the PC is, or in any other room like any of the bedrooms. The living room is the only room with that amount of space, and my house and space is quite large compared to most of my friends. My wife tends to watch TV/Netflix or play on the XBox while I'm gaming on the PC, so if I'm blocking the TV *while* gaming I don't see that going down well. If I can't use the extra features of the Vive because I don't have the space for a non-seated experience, I might as well get the Rift."
