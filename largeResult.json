The way Valve have \"solved\" this is by making the player able to move around in a 15 x 15ft room with the movement in the headset 1:1 with their actual body.

And really that's why games should be designed from the ground up for VR. They're going to be very non-traditional compared to what the average gamer is used to.\n\nI lied, though. There are tricks. \"Time Rifters\" from Proton Studio is pretty fast paced, involves rapid jumping &amp; fast turning, and I have never gotten sick inside of it. I'm sure they have many tricks that are cumulative to this magic formula, but most notably, proving a constant frame of reference in front of the player helps quite a bit.

    "text": "Great idea. And not only the dimensions of your room, you could also map furniture and other obstacles! I feel Microsoft's IllumiRoom/RoomAlive did something a little (but not totally) similar by integrating real-life objects and obstacles into the game world.\n\nI think it would work great when having a top-down view on tiny game characters you're commanding (like the tiny world demo on HTC Vive). Also puzzle games, or games with procedural levels, or something like Minecraft maybe. Also adventures that consist of a series of rooms through which you have to traverse and solve puzzles etc.\n\nOne more thought on this: Considering the endless variety in shapes of people's rooms, I think the game world would have to support highly modular design for this to work, so it might not be too well suited for the classic first-person action adventure/rpg/shooter type of game, that relies on architecture and level design a lot. Of course it's debatable if such classic game types would even work well in VR anyway. If they do, Valve's solution of fixed world design+variable boundary display sounds very cool and I'd be interested in a seeing a game using that. Also another solution was mentioned where the game world is displayed at an angle, so you think you're going straight, but you're actually running in large circles. Would have to be bigger than a 4.5m x 4.5m room though to be unnoticeable I think.\n\nIn any case, it's a really interesting thought, and a good example of the type of innovations in game design  that VR will make necessary. And it shows that the lines between VR and AR could become blurry sooner than we think, because how much of the \"real world\" has to/can be visible for it to still be called AR/VR?",

    "text": "I'm sorry but it's hard to even bring myself to read the article all the way through when it starts off by stating that, \"The HTC Vive and Sony\u2019s Project Morpheus were just unveiled\", while the Project Morpheus was unveiled back in March 2014. And promptly after mentions \"Magic Leap\" when it has nothing to even do with VR. Already that makes me fully aware that the author is greatly uninformed and not in a position to write an article like this, and whatever points they make further down will likely be disregarded because I'm not sure I can trust what they're saying.\n\nThis misinformed writing only continues as the article goes on, making it clear that the author has not even tried any of these devices themselves. \"The images are still pixelated and lag a tiny bit\", the image isn't *that* bad at all. Sure, you notice the screen-door effect when you focus on it, but the image itself is fine. And nobody has reported any lag on the latest prototypes, I really don't know where the author took that from.\n\n&gt;They don\u2019t mean that VR is indistinguishable from reality. As Jason Jerald, a technology consultant for VR companies, puts it, \u201cWe can get very engaged in cartoon-like worlds.\u201d Images don\u2019t have to look perfect for presence.\n\nHere we see the author's misunderstanding of the quote. And misunderstanding of what VR needs to be. In order for VR to work, we don't need photorealistic computer graphics, which is what the quote says. Yet, the author insists that photorealistic graphics are essential.\n\nThe author then goes in depth into his statement that latency is killing VR. Which, like I said before, nobody else has reported is the case. I'm not saying there isn't latency, but by now, it's not the cause of motion sickness. The reason why people get motion sickness with the latest VR devices is not latency, but seeing movement on the screen while actually sitting/standing still. Which is why nobody got motion sickness in the HTC Vive demos where they walked around themselves, or any other standing-up demos shown recently. Many people get motion sick in a car, myself included. Is there latency involved anywhere? No.\n\nThe vergence-accommodation conflict is the first part of the article where the author writes anything sensible. And yes, while this is something that should be worked upon, it isn't a key element that destroys a VR experience.\n\nThe wide field-of-view problem is also real and needs to be heavily considered once VR devices start actually reaching these higher FOVs. For now, we'll have to make-do with the lower FOVs, which is far from the solution, but it's good enough for the time being. Once again, it doesn't pull you out of the experience.\n\nMovement is another problem that hasn't been solved. Many different solutions have been suggested, but all of them are either impractical or temporary workarounds.\n\nOverall, this article failed to say anything we don't already know and gave a lot of false information in the first half.",

Did you click on the first link, read the article there, and read the comments?  Sometimes people are too lazy to do that, I have grown to have little patience for lazy people like that.  My reply means something, at least to me, because it is Denny Unger, first meeting me \"virtually\" on the net, at mtbs3d, in 2011, with palmer luckey there, (and I know many people like him) and the thread talks a lot about VR, how VR would best be served to help the COMMON MAN, joe six pack, maybe YOU if you are just a regular consumer.  It says HOME vr is not ideal, palmer luckey says this in that thread, because the software, and the hardware, just wont be up to speed, or affordable for the home user.  There is a guy called KEVIN WILLIAMS /user/kevinw729 that worked at disney, he made the disney alladin vr ride.  He wrote a book, the out of home immersive entertainment frontier, it interviewed palmer luckey, kevin williams promotes vrcades, he works with disney, with chuck e cheese, with dave and busters, with anyone who wants to do out of home VR or AR.  So I thought it would be helpful, to post the links, so people could go READ all the info, and get themselves educated and smarter, so they dont look dumb.  That palmer luckey said VR is best for joe six pack consumer at a VRCADE, that kevin williams promotes.  Here may be your difficulty, Palmer is NOW promoting AT HOME vr, against what he himself said years ago, but NOW he is under one mark zuckerberg, and he has to say certain things, or he doesn't make money now, he may be under contract with zuckerberg that if he doesn't deliver so many USERS into zuckerbergs ecosystem, he does not GET PAID.  That is probably true although I cant confirm one way or the other.  So people without CONTEXT, they get confused, they see palmer luckey said in 2011, that VR was best experienced by consumers at Vrcades like kevin williams makes.  But today he contradicts himself and says NO, use VR at home, but I claim that is just because NOW he has sold out to a dark empire in facebook, and that is why he makes himself look stupid, saying the EXACT opposite of what he said in 2011.  But many here at reddit say they dont have the hardware to push the best vr, but maybe a vrcade with million dollar hardwares would, and many here say they dont have the software maybe for good home vr, but million dollar software at a vrcade would be better, and many say they dont have SPACE to do an effective lighthouse solution, but a space at DISNEY that had hundreds of lighthouse basestations tracking multiple people, with hundreds if not thousands of feet, instead of just 15x15, is MORE SPACE.  Just like palmer luckey said would be BEST in 2011, before he sold OUT to mark zuckerberg.  I hope that clears it up for you, if its still not clear, specifically tell me what is confusing, and I will try to go deeper with explanations.  I am glad you came back and asked for clarification, the people that just do drive by insults, and dont come back, they dont really care about VR if you ask me.",

Apparently this martinlandau 00100100 and others that digideger brings up did use it.  Has lots of inside info.  Is trying his best to inform vive subreddit, valve steamvr subreddit, and other vr community members of what he can and not make his friends at Valve unhappy.  There may be ndas involved.  Still he feels it's important this community know certain details and histories.  Especially since for almost a year people at various subreddit thought Gabe and palmer were best friends and half life 3 was coming out on oculus hardware and maybe supported in oculus store.  So consider the messages here as public service announcements to help the Vive community.  Some may lack history.  Context.  Details.  This could affect their business decisions.  They may choose one solution over another.  The more informed they are, the better choices they can make.  Why would oculus moderators not let the community read this information and make up their own mind?   here is how it may affect you.  Maybe you as a developer were thinking of half life 3 extensions or add-ons and by being misinformed were making business plans for oculus hardware and software.  Thinking as many did that Gabe and palmer were beat buddies and half life 3 was coming out on oculus cv1.  However since that is not the case, it's better to have more information so developers and consumers can make better decisions for their future.  As digideger said about this martinlandau 00100100 persons or persons.  They got palmer started in 2009.  Know a lot about what is going on behind the scenes.  That oculus is not cool.  No half life 3.  Cause they angered gaben.  No mine craft vr because they angered notch. No 150 fov lenses because they angered david smith.  So it's been stormy seas.  Lots of us were unsure where to go.  Our ships crashing all over the vr sea.  But I have seen Gaben's lighthouse on the shore and he is going to bring me safely home through an awesome vr portal of security.  I hope you make the right choice",

Here in the UK an 'average' living room might only have 4-6 feet of free space between the TV and sofa, and I think the Kinect wanted 10 or something? We bought one and had to completely rearrange our living room, tipping sofas up against the wall on end, to have the space to use it every time we wanted to.\n\nSame goes for the Vive. IIRC it needs a 4'x6' space, minimum. I *just about* have that in my living room, in front of my TV, but I sure as hell don't in my office where the PC is, or in any other room like any of the bedrooms. The living room is the only room with that amount of space, and my house and space is quite large compared to most of my friends. My wife tends to watch TV/Netflix or play on the XBox while I'm gaming on the PC, so if I'm blocking the TV *while* gaming I don't see that going down well. If I can't use the extra features of the Vive because I don't have the space for a non-seated experience, I might as well get the Rift.",

    "text": "Ah! It'd good you're aware of that. Many naysayers will bring up issues that could have been solved if the demo were done correctly, but sometimes it's just not possible if a bunch of people are being shown rapidly. There's about a million things that all need to \"click\" at once for perfect visuals and immersion, and it can all go wrong if a few big ones aren't there.\n\nOne of those things is the IPD you're asking about. IPD = interpupillary distance. That is, the distance between the center (?) of one pupil to the other. This varies greatly with the size of the head and distribution of the face. It greatly affects how we perceive scale.\n\nOn the DK1 and 2, this is handled only on the software side. Ideally in the future, the distance between lenses can be set physically. This contributes to the \"sweet spot\" in the lenses, in the center.\n\nBut for now, there is an Oculuc Config Tool, where you can create per-person profiles, that include information like their gender, height (for games that want to take advantage), and IPD. There is a tool built-in that helps us measure our IPDs at the moment, but it's not super-precise.\n\nLong story short, you'll lose a lot of immersion if this is set incorrectly because the game would could seem way too big or way too small, depending on what the profile was set to when you demoed it.\n\nThen, ideally you'd have used 1 of 3 lenses that best suited you. The A-cup allows your face to be much closer to the screen and experience a slightly-better FOV, if you don't have glasses. Then the lenses can be dialed forward or backwards from the screen to help further.\n\nAnd then there's things like making sure the strap was incredibly tight, so that micro-movements don't shake the screen separately from your head to create a \"drift\" in the image. Then there's how much light was leaking into the Rift from the mesh holes at the bottom....or if you were using over-ear headphones that drowned out the sound around you.\n\nI could keep going but I think you get what I mean. That's not even considering the software side of things, of the efforts that must be made for the full effect, but all of the coaster demos I tried have been more or less fine.\n\n&gt; I didn't quite want to have it fully set up for my head and eyes because when Vive comes out, I want to get the full experience of VR when I earn it\n\nThat's awesome. I wish I had done that, but I guess I'm glad I got to tinker with the dev kits and experience the rebirth of an exciting technology. Of all I've read about the Vive, and I have almost ruined the VR illusion from developing with the kit and knowing how most of it works, I still think it's going to blow me away. It's truly exciting to hear about the resolution and motion controls. Having played a little bit with motion controls in VR in the past (Hydra), I can't say enough about how it adds to immersion, being able to interact with the environment in subtle movements that go beyond just looking around.",

This is because you're removing the stereo-information that tells you you're looking at a flat screen, and the depth cues you receive from the game rendering remain consistent)\n\nFundamentally, the two things that make VR graphically demanding are the wide FOV, requiring more things to be on screen at once, and the stereo rendering, requiring (right now) everything to be rendered twice. Pretty soon the second won't be an issue with optimisations coming down from hardware manufacturers.\n\nI think there's something to the idea that it might be worth sacrificing stereo rendering in exchange for a wider FOV. However, wider FOV requires hardcore optics research and development. Stereo is already close to perfect (just needs eye-tracking for precise placement of the virtual cameras)\n\nSo fundamentally I think you have a good point, but on the practical level I think that it's not worth the extra time and expense for a manufacturer to go after a 180\u00ad\u00b0+ FOV. But hey, I'd welcome a competitor to the current manufacturers offering a massive FOV in exchange for stereo vision (or even in addition to for high-end PCs?)!\n\nP.S.

Nice guys, cool tech. I met them at SVVR when they had their first rough prototype and I was like \"Dude, everyone is already well on their way... how are you going to catch SixSense and Leap?\". Now look at them.\nBravo! And best of luck!\n\n[\u2013]yathern 29 points 5 months ago* \nThis is fantastic news. Or at least pretty decent news - still have to make up my mind.\nI've long held that VR needs a new input device to be able to take off. Every time I demo the Rift, the first reaction is to look around, and then try to look at their hands - which inevitably come up invisible.\nOptical/Infrared hand tracking is far from perfect for a number of reasons, but I think the head-mounted solution will be enough to have at least a somewhat standardized input method for the CV1, and I'm really excited about how it will function when directly connected to the Oculus SDK and Service. It would be great for developers to have access to both relative and absolute hand position and skeletons taken directly from the service, since the software could automatically resolve hand position with the Rift/Camera position.\n\nYou are literally thinking everybody shares my views in hungary. Dude. VR is not the central of the world. VR is a fun technology-device. Not something that people make hardcore debates like you... But whatever... stopped wasting my time on you. \n\nHave a great one Brex",

There's completely different approaches: Gear VR / Zeiss One and all other mobile based headsets don't even have positional tracking (like the DK1). DK2 does have positional tracking but it has a comparatively small area where you can move and only works reliably when you're not turned the other way. SteamVR/Vive on the other hand, has near-perfect room-scale tracking and perfectly tracked controllers.\n\nSo there's actually complete games mechanics that will be totally awesome for SteamVR/Vive (or any \"room-scale VR setup\") that won't really work well with hardware that is oriented towards standing or seated experiences. On the other hand, if you have room-scale VR hardware (like SteamVR / Vive), you can of course easily play games that were designed only for seated/standing hardware.\n\nConcerning APIs: I believe currently, the most versatile approach is using SteamVR because this does support Oculus but also supports SteamVR/Vive. So from the purely technical perspective, you develop once and can run at least these both.\n\nWith Unity 5.1, you have native Oculus integration, native HoloLens integration is announced (that's AR, so it's a different story but it is related) ... Project Morpheus is already supported for Unity (but as far as I know not with the native integration that came with 5.1). Hopefully, eventually you'll be able to have a unified API/approach in Unity that allows you to build for all relevant different hardware approaches.
